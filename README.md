# About #

RodsWiki is a MediaWiki extension that enables MediaWiki file uploads to be stored in iRODS and to allow wiki users to download those files as well as to view and manipulate their metadata.
This enables storage for large scientific datasets to leverage the benefits of being stored in iRODS while still seamlessly interacting with standard MediaWiki interfaces.
