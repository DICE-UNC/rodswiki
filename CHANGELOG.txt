#24: Simplify RodsWiki's attempts to login to iRODS server.
#33: Upload file page does not correctly identify when files already exist

N/A: Content type for all files set to application/octet-stream for download
N/A: On upload page, path input box non-editable (still displays upload path).
N/A: Uploaded files no longer have first letter upcased.
N/A: MD5 hash results now consistent throughout RodsWiki.

Security:
Sanitized some input from iRODS server before displaying to client (incomplete)

Issues on-hold:
#7 : Clicking 'Upload File' without specifying a file path results in an
unhandled exception.

change filename

#16: iRODS search results do not reset when characters are deleted
#21: Inefficient hash used when uploading files without an explicit path
#22: iRODS credentials stored in plain text
#25: Remove ability for users to specify iRODS path for uploaded files
#26: Pare down RodsWiki code. Make it more readable.
#28: Input from iRODS server is insufficiently sanitized.
#29: Illegal/dangerous characters should yield an error if safe output
is not available
#30: Code review: Alter code to get rid of redundant object creation and
server calls.
#31: Remove unnecessary globals
#36: Metadata page appears to download files with no read permission
