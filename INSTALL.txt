Installation instructions for RodsWiki
(last edited v0.3.0)

Section 1: Prerequisites
Section 2: Installation

######## Prerequisites

    #### MediaWiki 1.22

A working [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) installation
(tested with versions 1.22.2, 1.22.5) and sufficient permissions to install
extensions are required.

We have no plans to support unstable releases of MediaWiki,
so RodsWiki does not currently support MediaWiki 1.23.

Help installing MediaWiki is available at:
    http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Installation.

      ## Optional Extensions

RodsWiki aims to support WYSIWYG editing via the VisualEditor extension:
    http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:VisualEditor
and the TemplateData extension:
    http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TemplateData

There are other dependencies, but to avoid confusion, the details are given
    below, in the installation section.

    #### iRODS

Access to a working iRODS server where the files will be stored is required.

The latest version of iRODS is available at:
    http://www.irods.org/index.php/Downloads
iRODS installation instructions are available at:
    http://www.irods.org/index.php/Installation
Note: iRODS servers can be installed in Windows but the iRODS Catalog cannot.

The MediaWiki and iRODS servers need not be on the same machine, as RodsWiki
    can connect remotely to iRODS servers.

#### RodsWiki ####




#### PHP API for iRODS ####

RodsWiki depends on PRODS from the PHP API for iRODS. If you choose to download
the RodsWiki source code directly, then you will need to download PRODS as well.
The PHP API for iRODS source is hosted at https://github.com/DICE-UNC/irods-php

The prods source directory is irods-php/prods/src
RodsWiki requires that src be included in the top RodsWiki directory as 'irods'.

######## Installation ########

RodsWiki has several dependencies.
These instructions assume that you have a working MediaWiki server.

    #### RodsWiki ####

      ## How to get it
       # Release Download

RodsWiki releases can be downloaded from the downloads section of the project
    page on Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/ajm475du/rodswiki/downloads

       # Source Download
The RodsWiki source code is available at:
    https://bitbucket.org/ajm475du/rodswiki

Recommend using the latest stable branch (currently stable-alpha).
stable-alpha will be equivalent to the latest release download.
The development branch is the latest "nightly" snapshot.
Bug fixes might be merged into the default branch between versions.

The RodsWiki directory belongs in the extensions directory of your MediaWiki
installation (MediaWiki/extensions).

Via Mercurial:
(HTTPS): hg clone https://JacobOlitsky@bitbucket.org/ajm475du/rodswiki
  (SSH): hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/ajm475du/rodswiki

The default branch is 'default'.
Run `hg update stable-alpha` in the RodsWiki directory to get the latest stable

      ## How to install it

00. Obtain RodsWiki by downloading the source or a release archive.
01. The RodsWiki directory must be uncompressed and placed in the `extensions`
    subdirectory inside of your MediaWiki installation.
02. Open "LocalSettings.php" located in your MediaWiki directory and add the
    following line at the end of the file:
    require_once "$IP/extensions/RodsWiki/RodsWiki.php";
03. Copy "RodsWiki.config.php.default" to "RodsWiki.config.php" and update the
    iRODS credentials to reflect your own configuration. This will be the
    default account; it is available to all wiki users.
04. If installing from source, ensure the RodsWiki/irods directory is in place.
    See the section titled "PHP API for iRODS" below for instructions on
    obtaining the prods source code.
05. Make sure to the maximum file upload size in your php.ini file is set to
    a value that meets your needs.
  a)  The location of php.ini varies by server. If you don't know where it is,
      try looking where you have php installed. apache/php is a common location.
  b)  Another option would be to create a ".htaccess" file in MediaWiki's root and add the following 2 lines:
        php_value post_max_size 32M
        php_value upload_max_filesize 31M
      "upload_max_filesize" must not be less than "post_max_size".
06. Now would be a good time to set the permissions on the RodsWiki directory.
    You should know what you're doing, here. Otherwise, get help from your
    systems administrator.
07. Startup your MediaWiki server and log in.
    If the installation was successful, you should see a link to
    'Upload media file' at the bottom of the toolbox on the left.
08. Optional.
    In order to use a custom login to your iRODS server, Go to "Special pages"
    then "iRODS User Management" (Special:SpecialIrodsUserManagement). Fill in the
    fields and submit.

RodsWiki should now be installed on your server.

    #### Optional: Adding WYSIWYG editing to MediaWiki with RodsWiki

In order to be able to simplify linking to iRODS hosted files using WYSIWYG
editing, there are several dependencies that must be met:
01. Node.js
02. Parsoid
03. VisualEditor
04. TemplateData
05. Template:IRodsFile

If any of these are already present, use caution, as they can inter-depend
on very specific versions.

      ## Node.js

Node.js is available from http://nodejs.org
It is also commonly available via Linux package repositories.
If you use a package-based install, be sure to install "nodejs" and not "node".
Tested with: v0.10.15, from the Ubuntu repository.

      ## Parsoid

Parsoid's homepage (of sorts) is at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid
Parsoid can be tricky to debug if something goes wrong, so carefully follow
the setup instructions.
Recommend using: The default branch at:
    http://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-services-parsoid

      ## VisualEditor

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:VisualEditor
Visual Editor is MediaWiki version dependent.
Conveniently, each Visual Editor version is numbered to match the version of
MediaWiki for which it was developed, so ensure that v1.22 is installed.
It can be downloaded directly from:
    http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor/VisualEditor
Or it can be pulled using git from:
    http://git.wikimedia.org/summary/mediawiki%2Fextensions%2FVisualEditor
For MediaWiki 1.22.x, use branch REL1_22

      ## TemplateData

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TemplateData
TemplateData is not available as a snapshot download.
It can be obtained using git from:
    http://git.wikimedia.org/summary/mediawiki%2Fextensions%2FVisualEditor
We've had the best success with the master branch.

      ## Template:IRodsFile
Template:IRodsFile is a MediaWiki template page written to work with
VisualEditor and TemplateData.
We distribute it as MediaWiki page exported to XML:
    Template-IRodsFile.xml
It is available for direct download on Bitbucket:
    http://bitbucket.org/ajm475du/rodswiki/downloads
It will also be included with release downloads (v0.3 onwards).
To import to MediaWiki, it can easily be done graphically through the
MediaWiki page Special:Import. Choose the file to be imported,
then click "Upload File".
